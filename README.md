## 📖 Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on recommending movies to content based on their historical categories and preferences. It includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment aspects of the project.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project

The primary motivation behind creating this project is to enhance user experience on movie platforms by providing personalized recommendations. This not only improves user satisfaction but also increases engagement with the platform.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains user ratings for various movies. It includes information such as user IDs, movie IDs, ratings, and timestamps. This data is essential for training the recommendation models.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed dataset for model compatibility.
- **Model Development:** Implemented collaborative filtering models for movie recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Deployment:** Integrated a simple web-based application for demonstrating movie recommendations.

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

Several collaborative filtering models were implemented and evaluated:

- Content based Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix Factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition, Alternating Least Squares)
- Hybrid Approaches (combining collaborative and content-based filtering)

Each model's performance was assessed based on metrics reflecting the recommendations' quality.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the correctness of predicted ratings.
- **Precision:** Measures the relevance of recommended items.
- **Recall:** Measures the coverage of recommended items.
